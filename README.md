# This project was created with SearchKit (searchkit.co)

I have attempted here to integrate login/Auth with JWT tokens

# To get started

Step 1:

`npm install`

Step 2:

`npm start`

# Notes

- User props {RequireAuth} to make those routes only available to logged in users
- I have removed `elastic` from require auth for testing purposes
